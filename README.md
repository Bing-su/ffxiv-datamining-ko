## [csv/](https://github.com/Ra-Workspace/ffxiv-datamining-ko/tree/master/csv)

* This repository keeps a record of CSV's extracted via [SaintCoinach](https://github.com/xivapi/SaintCoinach/releases) using the command `rawexd`, this is so they can be easily linked and referenced when datamining, so we have a git history of changes and just to make life easier in some cases :)

* All images of icon, map, and ULD are in [this repository](https://github.com/Ra-Workspace/ffxiv-datamining-ko-ui). The size is very heavy, so it has been separated.
