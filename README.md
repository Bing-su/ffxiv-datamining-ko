## [csv/](https://github.com/Ra-Workspace/ffxiv-datamining-ko/tree/master/csv)

* This repository keeps a record of CSV's extracted via [SaintCoinach](https://github.com/ufx/SaintCoinach/releases) using the command `rawexd`, this is so they can be easily linked and referenced when datamining, so we have a git history of changes and just to make life easier in some cases :)
