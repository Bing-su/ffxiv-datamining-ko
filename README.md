# Datamining of Final Fantasy XIV Korea

* This repository is to serve as a place to share data mining information related to Final Fantasy XIV in Korean.

* If you want to know datamining, go [viion/ffxiv-datamining](https://github.com/viion/ffxiv-datamining) and check docs.

* You can access data for each patch version using [tags](https://github.com/Ra-Workspace/ffxiv-datamining-ko/releases). Also if you want to access data older than data uploaded to this repository, go [here](https://github.com/Ra-Workspace/ffxiv-ko-datamining).

## [csv/](https://github.com/Ra-Workspace/ffxiv-datamining-ko/tree/master/csv)

* This repository keeps a record of CSV's extracted via [SaintCoinach](https://github.com/ufx/SaintCoinach/releases) using the command `rawexd`, this is so they can be easily linked and referenced when datamining, so we have a git history of changes and just to make life easier in some cases :)

## [ex/](https://github.com/Ra-Workspace/ffxiv-datamining-ko/tree/master/ex)

* It contains an archive list of the [SaintCoinach ex.json](https://github.com/ufx/SaintCoinach/blob/master/SaintCoinach/ex.json) file, ths main point was to keep a `ex.json` file per Patch, then if you wanted to extract data from an older patch (such as Korean or Chinese clients) you can hot-swap the `ex.json` file and extract data in the correct format.

## [Ra-Workspace/ffxiv-datamining-ko-ui](https://github.com/Ra-Workspace/ffxiv-datamining-ko-ui)

* All images of icon, map, and ULD are in [this repository](https://github.com/Ra-Workspace/ffxiv-datamining-ko-ui). The size is very heavy, so it has been separated.
